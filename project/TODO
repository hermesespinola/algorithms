1.- Describe the problemn you want to solve with the graph database.

2.- Initial implementation

You need to integrate in your initial implementation the following algorithms:

     a Sorting

     b Hash Tables

     c Binary Search Trees

     d Dynamic Programming - Graph Algorithms


I am expecting to see the classic:

1.- Software Requirements Specification.

2.- System Sequence Diagram
